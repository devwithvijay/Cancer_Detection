Breast Cancer Detection Model Using Deep Learning

In this project, I developed a deep learning model aimed at predicting breast cancer diagnosis based on a numerical dataset. The dataset included key features such as tumor size, texture, perimeter, and other clinical measurements. I implemented a Fully Connected Neural Network to classify tumors as either benign or malignant, achieving 93 percent accuracy on the test set.

The process involved extensive data preprocessing, including normalization and feature scaling to optimize the model's performance. I used TensorFlow & Keras to build and train the model and applied techniques like hyperparameter tuning to further enhance accuracy. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated through key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities.

This project showcases proficiency in applying deep learning techniques to solve real-world medical problems, contributing to the field of healthcare AI.
